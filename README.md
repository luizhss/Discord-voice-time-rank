# Discord voice channel watcher

Count the time a user spend on a voice channel. You can use `>r` to show the ranking of the users and `>c <NAME>` to have the time spend of a particular user.

To use it on your bot, you must create file named `.end` and write on it `DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN`.
